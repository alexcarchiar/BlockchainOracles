# BlockchainOracles

 Repo with all of the code written for my research on blockchain oracles.

Open the two directories `ChainlinkOracle` and `ProvableOracle` to find the consumer smart contracts used to interact with the oracles and the data source. The `DataSource` directory contains the Data source web application. Read its README to know how the app works. I recommend reading the paper for more information (I will add the links here once available)

**Video demos**
These demos show how the oracle work with a Data source and a data destination that queries the state of the oracles. The videos only interact with the Chainlink oracle.
